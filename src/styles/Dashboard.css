   The designs shows 3 cards. 
   On very small screens (320px), 1 col is best.
   On standard mobile (375+), maybe 1 or 2?
   Let's stick to 1 column for the cards to ensuring they have space, 
   or maybe scrollable row? 
   The prompt says "Display three stat cards showing...". 
   Let's use a scrollable row if it gets too tight or just stack them.
   Stacking them is safest for Vertical scrolling.
